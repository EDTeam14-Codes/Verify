# Verify

A repo for pointing Github Pages with our Domain:
To Verify our Website Ownership using an HTML file

Domain Rules to Point Github Pages
-
-Root Domains can use A or CNAME to point to Github Pages
-Subdomains use only CNAMES 

Drop a HTML verifcation file - then load it, eg. example.com/24354435.html. Test to see if it loads.
Once the system verifies your HTML record, you can remove the domain safely and move it to another host.
